					<h3>What is life insurance?</h3>

					<p>A life insurance policy is a binding contract between two parties, a customer and a life insurance company. At the customers demise the life insurance company makes a lump sum payment, commonly referred to as the death benefit, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries selected by the policyholder. <br />
					<br />
					The death benefit amount varies with every policy and it is usually determined by the needs of each individual customer. People without children or with children who are grown and financially independent won’t need as much coverage as growing families do. For example, a couple in their early 30’s with a new mortgage and two toddlers would need substantially more coverage than an independent elder who may only need enough to cover final expenses and a few minor debts. Of course there are exceptions to this rule as life insurance plays a huge roll in Estate planning.</p>
					<h3>What is a beneficiary?</h3>
					<p>The beneficiary of a life insurance policy is the person the customer selects to receive the death benefit at the time of the insureds passing. Beneficiaries are generally a spouse or child of the insured but there are some other options.  Some other common beneficiaries are universities, charities, trusts, estates, and businesses. You also have the option of having multiple beneficiaries.</p>
					<h3>Does the beneficiary have to pay taxes on the death benefit?</h3>
					<p>Generally speaking death benefits are income tax-free, however there are some rare occasions when Estate taxes could apply to insurance proceeds. Your situation should be reviewed by a licensed insurance professional before making any decisions. </p>
					<h3>How much does life insurance cost?</h3>
					<p>The cost of a life insurance policy can vary drastically based on a multitude of factors including the insureds age, health condition, coverage amount, tobacco use,  and the type of life insurance policy needed.
